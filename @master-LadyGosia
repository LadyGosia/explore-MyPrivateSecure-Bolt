I would like to ask GitHub about merge my new account which I sign up yesterday with NickName:
LadyGosia and my older account with name: master
NO Problem if should proof my Identity about Authorising the TRUTH ...
One more time repait right now:
The @master and LadyGosia have the same just one OWNER.
Exactly ME - LadyGosia is the only one person absolutely can manage @master project
No One else can't get Access to edit and make changes in MY Project.
@master is The Name and Project ONLY MINE OWN CREATED ABOUT SECURITY MATTER ON GITHUB PLATFORM.

Yesterday I saw absolutely strenge guy who was loged in to my @master.
I just need to say that he occupted my space with my project here on GITHUB platform.

But the Name and All Ideas of @master Project was Only My Way Scenario Create.
Write by Lady Gosia - Owner by @master.

Salut...
